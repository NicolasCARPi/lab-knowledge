* Look at your cells in a microscope to estimate the confluency
* Take media from the bottle and put it at 37Â°C
* Same with Trypsin
* Aspirate media from cells
* Rince with PBS (optional)
* Add the minimum volume of trypsin to cover the surface
* Put back in incubator for 2 mins
* Look at your cells in a microscope to check detachment status
* Aspirate your cells and add them to two times the same volume of media in a centrifugation tube
* Spin at 1200 rpm for 3 min
* Prepare the new flasks, write info on it
* Discard (aspirate) supernatant
* Add fresh media in the flasks
* Resuspend your cells in adequate volume
* Add to the flasks
