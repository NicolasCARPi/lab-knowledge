# Basics of microscopy

## The camera

### Types of camera

* Learn what are the differences between the types of camera: CCD, EMCCD, SCMOS, …
* You should know what is the pixel size

### Binning

## The microscope

### Types of microscopes

* Learn what are the differences between the types of microscopes: Widefield, Spinning Disk, Scanning, …
* You should have a basic idea of the light path in the microscope
* Learn the differences between the different filters you can have on the light path

## Acquisition

* It is better to acquire for a longer time at low laser power (or LED or Hg lamp) than a short exposure time with high intensity light
* Try to go to the lowest intensity light for a shortest time while still having a correct signal to noise ratio ([SNR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio))

## Live imaging

* Make sure the CO2 is ON
* Make sure the temperature is stable and correct (an external thermometer can help)
